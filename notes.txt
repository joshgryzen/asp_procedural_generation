Given parameters, geerate valid world - randomly 1 of room connections...

modularity - look at island scale/ big world scale, zoom in...

specifc things common across games:
- one island labeled boss island - DONE
- the boss island cannot be reachable within 2 or 3 steps (progression/distance) - DONE
- label every island with shortest distance from the beginning and the end - DONE
- distance from the beginning is associated with difficulty - DONE
- keys and doors:
   - blue key somehwere reachable from 1, but not behind the blue door - DONE
- bunch of level 1, 2,.. rooms assigned to each of the islands based on distance - DONE
-define a formula, where a goblin is 1 difficulty point, mummy is 2 difficulty points, skeleton is 1.5 difficulty - DONE
    - (assign to each island a random combination of enemies where the sum of their difficulty is less than or equal to the distance from the start)
    - distance 1 can have 1 goblin
    - distance 2 island can have 2 gobs, 1 mummy
    - distance 3...

start island is distance 0 - peace! - DONE

tell where bridges are, what enemies are assigned, where the key and door are - DONE

TODO: Verify that the encodings are correct. Add test cases!

11/17 notes:

can we dynamically  set the number of  islands?
compare to previous literature.
