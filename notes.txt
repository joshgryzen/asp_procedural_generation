Given parameters, geerate valid world - randomly 1 of room connections...

modularity - look at island scale/ big world scale, zoom in...

specifc things common across games:
- one island labeled boss island
- the boss island cannot be reachable within 2 or 3 steps (progression/distance)
- label every island with shortest distance from the beginning and the end
- distance from the beginning is associated with difficulty
- keys and doors:
   - blue key somehwere reachable from 1, but not behind the blue door 
- bunch of level 1, 2,.. rooms assigned to each of the islands based on distance
-define a formula, where a goblin is 1 difficulty point, mummy is 2 difficulty points, skeleton is 1.5 difficulty 
    - (assign to each island a random combination of enemies where the sum of their difficulty is less than or equal to the distance from the start)
    - distance 1 can have 1 goblin
    - distance 2 island can have 2 gobs, 1 mummy
    - distance 3...

start island is distance 0 - peace!

tell where bridges are, what enemies are assigned, where the key and door are
